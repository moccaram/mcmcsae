# Survey Analysis for Causes of Death
This script processes survey data to compute direct estimates of causes of death. The key functionalities include:

- **Survey Analysis**: Handles complex survey design features such as weights, strata, and clusters.
- **Smoothing and Prediction**: Applies smoothing techniques to adjust responses and sample sizes. Uses a Generalized Variance Function model to predict standard errors.
- **Data Imputation**: Replaces missing values with division-level means to ensure completeness of the data.
